Students get access to a central `GUACAMOLE` server, from there they can `RDP` into their Windows 10 machine and use SSH (native ssh in WIN10 or putty) to their Kali machine.

The guacamole server is : [**GUACAMOLE**](https://guacamole.th.denarm.be/#/)  
Credentials are : **studentXX**/WEWILLTELLYOU (where XX is a number from 01 to 15)
